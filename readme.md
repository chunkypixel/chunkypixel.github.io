# ChunkyPixel Games

We are a dedicated team of developers, designers, artists, programmers, and most importantly gaming enthusiasts who love to create retro-inspired arcade classics for the Atari 7800 game system.

The Atari 7800 has significantly improved graphics over the Atari 2600 bringing many classic arcade titles to the platform in it's heyday such as Pole Position II, Dig Dug, Centipede and Galaga. With modern development tools and the ability to use the Pokey audio chip right on the cartridge, the Atari 7800 is a platform ready to be brought into the future.

In recent years many new homebrew releases have been created such as Beef Drop, Bentley Bear's Crystal Quest, The Pac-Man Collection and Riki and Vicki thanks to the virbrant community of developers inspiring us to build our own homebrew games for the Atari 7800.
